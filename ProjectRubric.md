# Project Rubric

Your audience is the user, members of the general public who may want to use your data and/or code. To be useful, your code and documentation must be clear to naive users (people familiar with R, but not with this project). 

Elements:
1. Your github repo, organized following the project template.
2. Your modified code, quarto, and README files, organized in the repo.
2. Your output files (any requested output, i.e., `.csv`, `.html`, `.docx`, `.pdf` files) in their proper places in the repo.
